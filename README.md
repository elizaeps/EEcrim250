#### Literature Review: 

##### Healthcare in jails
In this review of literature, I aim to explain specific findings about healthcare in jails as well as touch on old studies in order to both contextualize medicine in jails and explain how this study contributes to the current literature available. There are two major current gaps in the current knowledge regarding healthcare in jails: many studies are older and many studies focus on specific aspects. That said, the goal of this paper is to give an overview of the availability of healthcare in Jails (specifically in the state of California). 

Before delving into statistics, it is crucial to remember that data represent human beings. Every individual at hand is someone locked up, without any alternative method for obtaining medical care.  Hatton et al. (2008) conducted a qualitative study analyzing inmates' perspectives on healthcare in jails. 78 women were interviewed in total. Inmates expressed feeling a lack of privacy and dignity when interacting with healthcare workers. Additionally, women in the sample expressed feeling a lack of autonomy regarding their own healthcare. 

Understanding that women in prison express extensive lists of problems regarding healthcare workers in prison, it is then crucial to observe specific aspects. This literature review focuses on components of healthcare, across identifiers and illnesses, in order to give an overarching view of the topic. It must be noted that many of the studies mentioned discuss prisons, as well as jails, but the study in this paper focuses only on jails. 
Population size:
	First, an interesting aspect regarding illnesses in prisons is population size. Wener and Keys (1988) focused on the impact that population size in jails has on the number of inmates appearing at sick call. The results showed that crowding in jails led to high rates of sickness within. That is, as the population increased as did the percentage of individuals appearing at sick call at a given jail. Both statistically and sociologically, it is reasonable that with more people present, there is a higher chance of illnesses spreading - both minor cases such as colds and more pertinent problems like HIV, as discussed later. Knowing this overall trend, this study will work to fill in gaps regarding connections between population and appearance at sick call. For example, it will be examined whether these trends are the same for each gender. 

##### Racial components:
	A common top regarding healthcare inequities is race. Dumont et. al (2014)  focused specifically on the racial component of healthcare in prisons. Notably, they found that black men and hispanic men, populations who often face health disparities outside of prison, actually have the same or higher rates of health screening than their white counterparts. That is, their paper discusses one of the few aspects of medical care within jails and prisons that is not worse compared to healthcare for non incarcerated individuals. For example, they found a statistically significant difference between rates of black and hispanic men receiving blood tests compared to white men. As another example, in their reports, equivalent percentages of black, white and hispanic males had their medical histories recorded at intake (around 80% for each population group). This is not to say that all groups received adequate care, but makes the argument that there are not major racial disparities in terms of availability of receiving healthcare in jails. It must be noted that this study only examined local jails, so it would be interesting to see how these rates compare to other correctional facilities such as federal prisons. While this paper discusses the lack of differences between populations within jails, it does not discuss the bigger picture of healthcare availability. Additionally, they focus on incoming and outgoing health screens, as opposed to treatment during an inmate's stay. 

##### Impact of age:
	When discussing particular populations within healthcare, it is vital to discuss elderly individuals. Taylor and Wertel (2014) studied the effect of age on healthcare in jails. According to the census bureau estimates, by 2030 about one third of individuals in the US will be over 55 years old. Notably, it is more expensive to house elderly inmates: it is estimated that it costs three times more for the government to house an inmate over the age of 55 than it is to hold a younger individual. Some individuals argue that inmates' threat to society should be questioned at a certain age and they should be released if they are deemed safe. In a general population, on average, geriatric individuals (people over 65) have one chronic illness. In contrast, geriatric inmates have an average of three chronic conditions. Such conditions may include hypertension, cancer and strokes. Additionally, as discussed in a future section, prisoners are more susceptible to infectious diseases. Tying this information together, elders in prison are especially prone to infectious diseases (such as tuberculosis, scabies and HIV). Further, Taylor and Wertel describe that it is likely for these diseases to readily advance due to lack of proper healthcare within jails. Finally, it is described how elders need unique accommodations within healthcare, such adjustments that are not taught to jail staff. For example, elders tend to require more privacy as well as extra preventative health care. This qualitative review of elderly healthcare in prison helps contextualize factors in understanding the study conducted in this paper. As I describe the rates of healthcare response in jails, it is vital to note the specific populations within, such as elders. 

##### Mental health 
	When discussing healthcare, it is vital to discuss mental health. Proctor et. al (2018) analyzed a group of 200 male jail inmates in search of substance use disorders classified by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV). In doing so, they found that 87% of their sample met the criteria for at least one substance abuse disorder. Additional studies have found similarly high rates of mental health disorders among inmates. In filling in gaps, this study will analyze rates of mental health pills and mental health beds within jails. 

Interestingly, in Fazel et al. (2017) review of suicides in prisons across 24 countries, they found that there was no correlation between a country’s general population suicide rate and their inmate suicide rate. Of the 24 high income countries studied between 2011 and 2014, there are 3,906 inmate suicides. Circling back, it is vital to remember that these data are pertaining to human beings: each of the individuals within these rates, both with mental health disorders and those who died by suicide, are people living alone in harsh, brutal conditions, with no one looking out for them. 

##### Sexually transmitted diseases
	In a highly condensed population, it is reasonable that sexually transmitted diseases spread rapently in prisons. To gauge a sense of numbers, in 2009, there were 20,880 intimates who tested positive for HIV or AIDS. While there was a decline to 20,092 in 2010, the rates were still concerningly high (Maruschak, 2010). That said, between 2001 to 2010 there was a 16% decline in the number of inmates with HIV/AIDS. More recent counts have not been conducted. In 2005, a study found that half of the AIDs patients in prison were in the south. Additionally, there were higher positivity rates among older populations. There have been recent urges to increase screening for all sexually transmitted diseases within jails. Kraut-Becher et al. (2004) explained the cost effectiveness of screening inmates for gonorrhea and chlamydia. The paper explains that correctional facility pose high threats for contracting sexually transmitted diseases and screening upon entrance could prevent spread. In contrast to money saved for female prisons, in terms of screening rather than treating, they found that for male prisons universal screening would cost $4,856 per case more than treating the cases. That said, for female correctional facilities, they found that universal screening would save exuberant amounts of money. While the study done in this paper does not fill in gaps in terms of sexually transmitted diseases, it is helpful to contextualize some illnesses that pose grave threats in order to understand the rates of individuals needing medical care. 

##### Pregnancy in prison: 
An interesting population to examine are pregnant women in prison because not only does this healthcare impact an individual, it affects the next generation. With relation to this study, it is interesting to note the prenatal care available to pregnant women in jails and prisons.

McCall, Casteel and Shaw (1985) found that among their sample, prenatal health care providers in prisons were described as insensitive and unhelpful. The prenatal care offered did not meet the national standard for prenatal care. There were not early identification checks for pregnancy and rare examinations for signs of high risk pregnancy. It is crucial to note that this study was conducted over thirty years ago and much has evolved in the medical field since. That said, qualitative studies of this type have not been replicated since. This study merely helps emphasize the extent to which this population has been historically overlooked.

That said, Cordero el. Al (1992) found that prematurity and SGA (“small for gestational age”) were less common for the babies born to women in her sample who received legitimate prenatal care than for those who did not. She found that the prematurity rate among those without care was around 20% and the rate for those who received care was 3%. In a previous study, Cordero et al (1991), found that women with short sentences faced a greater risk of perinatal mortality than those with longer sentences due to increased treatment, nutrition and structure. Additionally, Howard et al. (2008) found a statistically significant increase in birthweight of babies born to incarcerated mothers for each prenatal care visit that the mother received. Like other populations mentioned, these studies help explain the individuals within the study of jail populations within healthcare. 

##### Transition out of jail:
	A key note to discuss in the context of healthcare in jails is the transition back into the community. Many inmates who do receive medical care while incarcerated have difficulty reentering society where they do not have healthcare coverage. Under the 8th amendment, the government is required to provide adequate healthcare to inmates. That said, Marks and Turner (2014) discuss the problem for underserved individuals transitioning from receiving healthcare in jails to losing coverage when they are released. They explain how the Urban Institute estimated that around 30 percent of certain local corrections budgets are put towards medical care. Their paper was written as the Affordable Care Act was being implemented, so their overarching goal was to provide advice for policy changes moving forward.  

Understanding the illnesses that spread in prisons as well as the lack of adequate healthcare raises interest in the overall availability of healthcare. Additionally, many studies focus primarily on prisons. This study fills in gaps by giving an overview of the healthcare responsiveness (how often doctors are seens, beds are available and pills are given) and focuses entirely on jails.

RE: Health care in Jails 

On the website, this is written in an R script -- I was not sure how to include the tables figures on here, so this has the coding, but I have also emailed the R markdown 

---
title: "EDA California Data"
output: html_document
---

I decided to work with a new data set because the inmate data set that I had downloaded was not "cleaned" - when loading the data in R, it gave instructions on how to clean each line. Because I was not immediately excited about any of the variables, I felt that it would be more efficient to go on Jacob Kaplan's website (as we had learned about in Crim 250) in order to find a data set that was well organized and simpler to analyze (using my skill set). I found this data set specifically on jails in California and noticed variables related to health care. Due to the fact that I ultimately want to work as a doctor in prisons, I was immediately drawn to these variables. Below, I have show my initial EDA of the health care related variables within this data set.

Moving forward, my goal is now to write a descriptive thesis about health care in jails. I want to show both the differences in certain variables over time as well as the differences between certain variables.

              - discussion: data analysis in words
              - conclusion: policy/change implications (the need for improved health care in prisons)
    
    
I first downloaded Jacob Kaplan's R files on the California jail surveys 1995 to 2020. The rows represent each Jail's monthly report and each column represents a factor of reporting. While the data focuses more generally on statistics such as number of female inmates, number of inmates awaiting trial and number of inmates transported to prison, I am focusing specifically on the health care data within. 

```{r}
setwd("~/Desktop/california")
dat <- read.csv("california_jail_survey_1995_2020_csv 2/california_jail_county_monthly_1995_2020.csv")
names (dat)
```

I have listed all of the variables to show what is available within this data for each monthly report. 

```{r}
summary (dat$num_inmates_seen_sick_call)
```

```{r}
summary (dat$num_doctor_occurrences)
```
I wanted to show the difference in numbers for inmates seen at sick call as opposed to the number of inmates seen by a doctor. "Sick call" is a request for health care services. That is, the vast difference in inmates whose sick calls were accepted in contrast with the number seen by a doctor is notable. 

```{r}
t.test(dat$num_inmates_seen_sick_call,dat$num_doctor_occurrences)
```
In order to show the difference, I ran a ttest and found a stastically significant difference between the number of inmates seen at sick call and the number of inmates seen by a doctor per month in the California jails from 1995 to 2020. 


```{r}
hist(dat$num_inmates_seen_sick_call, col='red',xlim = c(0,50000))
hist(dat$num_doctor_occurrences, col='blue', add=TRUE, xlim = c(0,50000))
```

I then created a histogram to visually show this difference. While the labels are off, it is a good starting point. The red represents the inmates seen at sick call and the blue represent the inmates seen by a doctor. 


```{r}
counts <- table(dat$num_doctor_occurrences, dat$year)
barplot(counts, main="Number of Doctor Visits", xlab="year")
```

I was interested to see if there was a difference in the number of doctors visits over time, but this bar chart does not seem to show a pattern. That said, I was surprised to see somewhat of an apparent decrease over time. I assumed there would be an increase over time. I was unsure of other ways to test changes over time, but this could be something to delve into further. 

```{r}
summary (dat$num_new_mental_health_cases)
summary (dat$highest_inmate_count)
summary (dat$avg_inmate_need_reg_med_attent)
summary (dat$num_inmate_get_mental_heath_bed)
```
Further, I was curious about the mental health factors included. I looked at the summarizing values fo mental health cases and found a median of 44 new cases per month in each facility. Initially I looked at the mean, but noticing the high maximum and the great difference between median and mean, it seems as though the mean is being skewed by high values on the maximum end. Looking at the values for highest inmate count at a given moment, the median value is 406. While 44 is much lower than 406, I was still blown away by the high number of reported mental health cases. I assume that the number of mental health cases in total (with both reported and unreported) would be even higher. I am not surprised, but the number of inmates recieving mental health beds is rather low relative to the number of mental health cases -- the median is zero. 

```{r}
hist(dat$mental_heath_case_open_end_month, col='red',xlim = c(0,6000))
hist(dat$num_inmate_get_mental_heath_bed, col='blue', add=TRUE, xlim = c(0,6000))
```
I tried to make a histogram comparing the number of mental health cases (red) to the number of inmates in mental health beds (blue), but this is messy and difficult to analyze. I kept it here as a rough draft, because I still believe that could be an interesting comparison.


```{r}
t.test(dat$mental_heath_case_open_end_month, dat$num_inmate_get_mental_heath_beds)
```

I was curious to run a t test between these variables to see if the differences are in fact statistically signifiant. 

```{r}
counts <- table(dat$num_new_mental_health_cases, dat$year)
barplot(counts, main="Number of Doctor Visits", xlab="year")
```

I then created a bar chart showing the number of mental health cases over time and was again surprised to see an overall decline - I wonder why fewer cases were reported. 

```{r}
summary (dat$avg_inmate_in_hospital)
```
I was curious to see the summary of inmates in the hospital at a given time and was surprised to see the low rates. I would be curious to see quite how extreme a case has to be for an inmate to be brought to the hospital.

```{r}
counts <- table(dat$avg_inmate_in_hospital, dat$year)
barplot(counts, main="Number of Inmates in the Hospital", xlab="year")
```
I created a bar chart of the number of inmates in the hospital over per year; I am honestly not quite sure exactly what the color coding means for each bar. I notice that the rates remain rather stable over time 


```{r}
summary (dat$num_dental_encounters)
```

I am disappointed, but not shocked by the low levels of dental encounters within jail. In part, this makes sense because many inmates in jail are there are short periods of time (and therefore would not need dental checks), but the numbers are still rather low. 


```{r}
counts <- table(dat$num_dental_encounters, dat$year)
barplot(counts, main="Dental Encounters", xlab="year")
```

I created a bar plot to view the change in dental visits over the last 15 years. There does not seem to have been reports of dental visits priot to 2001. 


```{r}
hist(dat$num_inmate_get_psych_meds, col='red',xlim = c(0,1500))
hist(dat$avg_inmates_need_reg_ment_health, col='blue', add=TRUE, xlim = c(0,1500))
```

I was then curious to see a histogram of inmates who recieve psych meds (red) compared to inmates who need regular mental health help (blue). I am honestly unsure how to view this histogram because I wonder how this relates to a general population (I do not know what a general rate of psychiatric mediction is)

```{r}
t.test (dat$num_inmate_get_psych_meds,dat$avg_inmates_need_reg_ment_health)
```

From there, I decided to run a t test comparing the rates of inmates who need regular mental health help compared to inmates who recieve psychiatric medication. 


## Memo 3

RE: fresh start! 

The dreaded day came: we decided to pause this project and start from scratch. Ideally, at some point in the future I will finish this initial thesis. I began going through data files to decide what I was interested by. Initially, I was interested by racial and gender differences of suicides in prisons. That said, the information of death of inmates is part of the NACJD restricted data set. I talked to Lauris Olsen about this project and my interests in general. He explained that it could be a simple process to retrieve access, but takes about 3 weeks. While I am interested by this topic, I am not married to this question enough to risk more time issues with data retrieval. He did ultimately lead me to a data set that is fully downloadable that only contains the public variables from the initial data set I was interested in: 

https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/web/NACJD/studies/38048/variables?start=50&sort=STUDYID%20asc%2CDATASETID%20asc%2CSTARTPOS%20asc&STUDYQ=38048&EXTERNAL_FLAG=1&ARCHIVE=NACJD&rows=50#

From there, I read through the code book to think about what variables I was interested by. I noticed the variable "Highest level of education by inmate" (EDUCATION). I assumed that there were many published studies on correlation between certain crimes and level of education, but there have actually not been said studies in many years (and many do not cover everything I would be interested in). I believe it could be interesting to study the correlation between levels of education and each crime reported. For example, I wonder if there is a statistically significant difference in the number of murders committed by those with and without a high school diploma. Without prior knowledge, my assumption would be that most crimes (murder, rape, public offenses) decrease with increased level of education (as old studies have suggested) and that fraud would increased with increased level of education. I would want to look generally, but also specifically by race, gender, age of admission and state. I would be interested in comparing outcomes based on different states due to the different qualities of education in different states (that is, a high school diploma in one state is not necessarily equivalent to a high school diploma in another). Right now this is a rather general question, but I would love to discuss more about which aspects you find interesting. 

my proposed schedule moving forward:

    - prior to spring break(March 3): finalize question, load the data, write methodology section

    - during spring break (March 14): write my literature review, research design
    
    - two weeks following spring break (March 24): data analysis, tables, tests (Results section)
    
    - (March 31): put data analysis into words - discussion & conclusion
    
    - (April 7): write introduction 
    
    - (April 14): finalize Abstract, edit ALL
    
    - (April 21): submit final thesis 


## Memo 2

FROM: Eliza Epstein

DATE: February 15, 2022

RE: Problems with Methodology & FIOIA request 

Last week, I was hopeful that I would be able to make the assumption that the state payment method could be used to represent inmates in my study population. That said, when I loaded the data, I was disappointed to find that that population contains 39,893 births (a number that greatly exceeds the numbers of babies born to inmates every year). While 50,000+ pregnant women agree put in prison every year, only a few thousand give birth while incarcerated. My next goal was to subtract as many women from that group as possible, but am happy great difficulty in doing so. I found a variable called "WIC receipt" which is a special supplemental nutrition program: my guess is that women covered by state may also receive this (which inmates would not because prisons provide food) so my thought is this group could be eliminated. When I applied "table(dat$wic)", there were 1,568,093 individuals who receive this service. I would need help discerning the group that both receive this and receive state payment to see the number here. I created a table to figue out the number of individuals who reccieved "other government payment", but did not receive the special supplemental nutrition program and was left with 15,034 births (a number still too high to assume these are inmates) I went through every other variable and was unsure of what other variables could be used to isolate the desired population. 

Going back to the drawing board,  I checked on the status of my FIOIA request (I had requested data from all federal prisons in October on birth outcomes) — it had said that it may take up to nine months (which surpasses the date for when this thesis is due). That said, it says that to speed up requests it can be helpful to simplify the request — I am going to try to simplify in attempts to receive the data sooner — I do not know that this will work but it is worth a shot. 

Finally, I used dplyr to select only the variables I will be working with (due to the large size of the data set). I decided to select the following variables:
 
 - mother's age (mager)
 - mother's level of education (meduc)
 - mother's race (mbrace)
 - month prenatal care began (precare_rec)
 - number of prenatal visits (previs_rec)
 - whether the mother smoked cigarettes during pregnancy (cig_rec)
 - payment method (pay)
 - whether the mother used a special supplemental nutrition program (wic)
 - the baby's APGAR score 5 minutes after birth (apgar5r)
 - the baby's APGAR score 10 minutes after birth (apgar10r)
 - birth weight (bwtr12)
 - poor birth outcome (rf_ppoutc)

RE: New Methodology - Payment Method 

While initially my plan was to separate the CDC Natality data by FIPS codes to isolate female prisoners, I have recently discovered that prior to 2014 (with the implementation of the Affordable Care Act) states paid for childbirths for inmates. I am now planning on separating my study populations based on payment methods. My goal is to compare birth outcomes of inmates to those of a general population and to an underserved population. My most updated idea is to separate my three study populations as payment by “other government” (meaning inmates), payment by “self payer” (general population), and “medicaid” (underserved population). In Kozhimannil and Schlafers article “What The Affordable Care Act Means For Pregnant Inmates”, they describe "The ACA also allows Medicaid to pay for inmates’ care for hospital stays longer than 24 hours. Such changes have important implications for a group of inmates that is not often the focus of health policy dialogue – incarcerated pregnant women." Additionally in Markus et. al’s paper “Medicaid Covered Births, 2008 through 2010, in the context of the implementation of health reform”, they describe that “When pregnant inmates give birth, costs are generally paid by the county or state that administers the facility in which they are incarcerated.” For this reason, I will be using data prior to 2014 (before the ACA) when states paid for inmates’ childbirths. Due to the 1978 Pregnancy Discrimination Act, in about 40% of states, employer insurance plans were required to cover maternity care. While there were requirements on private insurance plans covering maternity care, there were many restrictions on state coverage (making it difficult for women to get state coverage for childbirth) - about 45% of childbirths were covered under medicaid, a separate payment method in the data. Selfishly for this paper, that is beneficial due to the fact that the implication is that few pregnant women outside of inmates were covered by the “payment by state” sector. That said, this methodology displays a clear limitation: state payment may include many more childbirths than just incarcerated women. That said, given the scale of this research paper (being an undergraduate thesis), I believe this problem can be discussed within the paper, rather than being a reason to create a new methodology. I had submitted a FOIA request to receive data on inmate birth outcomes, but was informed that this data will take up to 9 months, a time scale that I do not have.

# Thesis Proposal

This proposal was completed as my final project for Crim 410. 

## Abstract

Given the health disparities for incarcerated women, researchers have begun analyzing birth outcomes of babies born to imprisoned mothers. That said, there is a lack of comparative studies, analyzing health data from within prisons in conjunction with birth outcomes outside of prison. Due to the prevalence of underserved women within prisons, it is necessary to compare the birth outcomes of incarcerated women to both that of a general population and that of a disadvantaged population. This study uses CDC National Vital Statistics System natality data to compare specific outcomes such as birth weight, infant mortality and APGAR score for the given populations. The overall goal is to determine which of the study populations have the highest prevalence of adverse birth outcomes. Further, the outcomes will be analyzed to conclude if there exists a statistically significant difference between the birth outcomes of babies born to incarcerated mothers and babies born to women outside of prison, both in a general population and an underserved population.

## Introduction

Given the growing prevalence of pregnancy in prison, it is becoming more vital to understand the weight that this undesirable circumstance carries. Past studies have descriptively displayed facts and figures regarding prenatal incarceration. That said, there is a lack of comparative data on birth outcomes of imprisoned women to women outside of prison. The goal of this study would be to determine the impacts of imprisonment during pregnancy. The data will be used to compare the rates of adverse birth outcomes in each study population and to determine if there is a statistically significant difference between birth outcomes of women in prison and birth outcomes of women in a general population as well as women in an underserved population. Overall the question being studied is how does prenatal incarceration impact birth outcomes?

Like with many other underrepresented populations, women in prison are often not discussed until disasters hit. The stories of Diana Sanchez and Andrea Circle Bear are the two most recognized stories of pregnant women in prison in recent years. Diana Sanchez went into labor while alone in her jail cell in Denver, Colorado in July 2018. She began screaming for help, but was blatantly ignored by the guards. No one called for medical help. Surveillance videos show her entirely giving birth to her son alone in her jail cell while wailing for help . She speaks out about the pain being unbearable (Chiu, 2019). The video of her childbirth is now widespread on the internet and she ultimately received a cash payment. That said, no amount of money could overcome the trauma she experienced. Further, Andrea Circle Bear was in prison in 2020 at the peak of the coronavirus pandemic. She was given a 26 month sentence for selling methamphetamine. She was pregnant and contracted coronavirus due to outbreaks within the prison. Although pregnant women were told to take extra precautions during the pandemic, no additional efforts were made within her facility to protect her. When her symptoms worsened, she was placed on a ventilator. The baby was rescued in a cesarean section, but she ultimately died (Bogel-Burroughs, 2021). These two devastating stories represent the maltreatment that occurs for this given population. Further, they are reminders that the rare occasions when pregnant women in prison are discussed in the media occur when tragedies take place. Stories like these two motivate the need for more research to be done. This paper aims to shine light on this vulnerable population as well as highlight its impacts on the resulting babies.
Studies have been conducted to analyze the prevalence of pregnancy within prisons. Dr. Carolyn Sufrin has published statistics on the prevalence of prenatal incarceration as well as the associated birth outcomes. Using this data, tables were made to display birth outcomes in 2016: (had difficulty inserting images)

While it is informative to view the birth outcomes, they are difficult to analyze without knowledge about expected rates of certain birth outcomes among general populations. That is, without comparisons, conclusions cannot be drawn from this data. For example, it is unclear when viewing this data alone if the seemingly high rates of cesarean deliveries is expected among a group of randomly sampled births or if it is telling of adverse birth outcomes. Further, the state level data can stand to represent general themes, but individual data is needed in order to extrapolate trends. Viewing the overall values motivates the need to compare birth outcomes of imprisoned women to the non-incarcerated population.

## Literature review

### Prenatal Incarceration

Two popularly researched groups are pregnant women and imprisoned individuals. That said, much less research has been done on the overlap between these two already vulnerable groups: pregnant women in prisons. Before exploring specificities about birth outcomes, it is important to first contextualize prenatal incarceration.

To begin, there have been a few qualitative studies including interviews and surveys about pregnancy behind bars. Wismont (2000) conducted a study to explain the experience of being pregnant in prison. While much has changed in the past twenty years, this background knowledge gives a general context for pregnancy in US prisons. She interviewed twelve participants, asking them about their pregnancy experiences. Some of the women in the study had been pregnant before, so they could describe first hand the difference of being pregnant within and outside of the prison. They explained specific stressors such as the lack of choices about their care, the powerlessness and isolation during an already stressful experience and fears of saying goodbye to the baby. In my research study, I want to quantify these differences. While this study is thought provoking, it is merely these twelve womens’ opinions on their experiences. It raises the question of whether this experience is quantifiably different.
Similarly, Dolan et al. (2019) analyzed the mental health of pregnant women in prison in the UK. Of the group studied, she found that 51% had depression and 57% had anxiety. That said, when regarding mental health in this topic it is difficult to pinpoint the causation due to regular hormonal shifts during any pregnancy and increased mental health concerns during imprisonment. That is, it is unclear how much is due to the pregnancy alone, how much is due to the imprisonment alone and how much is the overlap. Regardless, it is noteworthy that more imprisoned pregnant women in this study had diagnosable mental health concerns than not. The larger picture of prenatal pregnancy has been studied and has been shown to have detrimental effects when interviewing women. On a personal level, the lack of autonomy, the physical discomfort and the loneliness, among many other issues, have great impacts on a woman’s pregnancy experience. That said, does it have substantial impacts that would affect birth outcomes?

### Pregnancy outcomes in Prisons in the US

More specifically, questions have been raised about both prevalence of and outcomes for incarcerated mothers. Sufrin et al. (2017) conducted a study analyzing pregnancy outcomes in prisons. Their goal was to complete a descriptive study explaining the frequency of pregnancy in prison as well as the birth outcomes with the intention of urging policy makers to make changes which could lead to improved overall outcomes. The data collected included the amount of pregant women, the amount of births, misccarriages, abortions and mortality rates. They found that 92% resulted in live births, 6% in miscarriages, 1% in abortions, 0.5% in stillbirths and 0.5% newborn deaths.

Among a different team of researchers, Dr. Carolyn Sufrin et al.(2020) studied pregnancy rates and outcomes in U.S jails. Following a similar methodology, Sufrin found that approximately 3% of females admitted to jails in the US are pregnant. In this sample, she found 64% were live births, 18% were miscarriages, 15% were induced abortions and 1.8% were ectopic pregnancies. Of the births, 1⁄3 were cesarean sections and 8% were premature deliveries. There were two stillbirths and one newborn birth. This raw data is compelling, but is difficult to analyze when not compared to these rates of other populations.

 These descriptive studies are helpful starting points to both view the general relevant information and to emphasize that, while overall the sample size is relatively small, there are enough incarcerated pregnant women for this to be a topic worth emphasizing. This information alone is intriguing, but it raises questions about how this population compares to populations outside of prisons. It is difficult to analyze the birth outcomes without a context of comparable information in a different population. For that reason, I want to use similar information to compare birth outcomes within the prison system to birth outcomes in the general population of the US.

### Prenatal care in prisons

One of the greatest factors of pregnancy during imprisonment is the prenatal care available. Under the 8th amendment, incarcerated pregnant women are required to be given health checks. McCall, Casteel and Shaw (1985) found that among their sample, prenatal health care providers in prisons were described as insensitive and unhelpful. The prenatal care offered did not meet the national standard for prenatal care. There were not early identification checks for pregnancy and rare examinations for signs of high risk pregnancy. It is crucial to note that this study was conducted over thirty years ago and much has evolved in the medical field since. That said, qualitative studies of this type have not been replicated since. This study merely helps emphasize the extent to which this population has been historically overlooked.

That said, Cordero el. Al (1992) found that prematurity and SGA (“small for gestational age”) were less common for the women in her sample who received legitimate prenatal care within prison than for those who did not. She found that the prematurity rate among those without care was around 20% and the rate for those who received care was 3%. A previous study found that women with short sentences faced a greater risk of perinatal mortality than those with longer sentences due to increased treatment, nutrition and structure (Cordero et al, 1991). Additionally, Howard et al. (2008) found a statistically significant increase in birthweight of babies born to incarcerated mothers for each prenatal care visit that the mother received.
Much like the data on birth outcomes, the information on prenatal care is thought provoking, but without comparing it to data outside of prisons, it is difficult to put in context. While healthcare for pregnant women can be impersonal and insensitive, it raises questions about how that prenatal care compares to women in underserved communities outside of prisons. Furthermore, the information about the benefits of prenatal care raise questions about whether prenatal checks make equally substantial differences for the general population.

### Birth outcomes of prenatal incarceration compared to general populations

Knowing the prevalence and outcomes of prenatal incarceration, it is then crucial to compare that information to general populations. That said, due to the fact that imprisoned women often come from disadvantaged backgrounds, it is vital to acknowledge that confounding factor. In order to do so, birth outcomes in prisons can be compared both to a general population, but also to disadvantaged populations. Knight and Plugge (2005) found in a systematic review that there were significant differences for childbirths of incarcerated women as compared to both the general population and compared to disadvantaged women. They reviewed studies analyzing cohorts all around the world including England, Germany and the US. They found that imprisoned women are more likely to deliver preterm and have below average weight babies than women in a general population. In contrast, imprisoned women are less likely to deliver preterm and have below average weight babies than women in disadvantaged populations. That is, according to the studies analyzed here, imprisonment of the mother may be beneficial for babies of disadvantaged women. That could be due to guaranteed meals, housing and health checks. While this study shows the outcomes of interest, it is both from 2005 and compiling international data. This paper will contribute a more updated analysis, as well as a centralized view of the United States alone. Elton (2009) found that women admitted later in their pregnancies had statistically significantly lower weight newborns than babies born to mothers who were not incarcerated. That said, there was no statistically significant difference for women admitted earlier in their pregnancies. Martin et al. (2011) found no statistically significant difference in infant birth weights among women incarcerated during pregnancy, but found that low birth weight was more common among babies of mothers who had been previously incarcerated as compared to women who had never been incarcerated. 

Walker et al. (2014) conducted a study in New South Wales, Australia in 2014 comparing perinatal outcomes of incarcerated women and disadvantaged women. This was a cohort study analyzing medical records of babies whose mothers were incarcerated at the time of their birth. They searched for an array of adverse birth outcomes including premature births, low birthweight, different forms of birth, admissions to the neonatal intensive care units, onset of labor and infant mortality. They found that within their sample, the women who had been incarcerated during their pregnancy showed an increased chance of adverse birth outcomes. This study analyzed precisely what this paper is aimed at doing: the key difference being the country in question. While imprisonment has similarities between different countries, we cannot equate incarceration in Australia with incarceration in the US. For that reason, this paper will replicate this study using data within the US.


## Data 

The data source is the Center for Disease Control and Prevention’s National Health Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) National Vital Statistics System Natality data. The NCHS collects data on all registered births in all 50 states through electronic files. The given data source releases all individualized data for childbirths in the United States by year. Each row represents an individual with columns indicating specific details such as location of birth, identifying factors about each parent and results of the birth. The three main outcomes of interest are birth weight, infant mortality and Apgar score. In order to isolate imprisoned women, the data will be sorted based on FIPS county codes as well as forms of payment. Due to the fact that the CDC no longer releases all FIPS county codes, restricted data was requested. The individualized birth data from 2000 through 2013 will be used. The study population is broken into three parts:

Incarcerated population: In order to isolate the incarcerated population, the data will be sorted by FIPS area codes. The area codes which indicate locations of prisons will be used to distinguish births to incarcerated mothers. Further, prior to the implementation of the Affordable Care Act states would pay for child births for imprisoned women. For that reason, data prior to 2014 was used in order to incorporate the payment method, to highlight payment by state.

Underserved population: The group that is considered underserved is based on the principal source of payment for the delivery. Payment by medicaid can be indicative of pregnant individuals who are less socioeconomically privileged. Once the incarcerated population is isolated, the population which was paid for under medicaid will be separated.

General population: The general population covers an all encompassing population, excluding those which fit into the incarcerated population. This general population will be the largest sample size of the three, given that it is all births from 2000 to 2013 in the US which do not fall into the experimental population.

## Hypothesis and Research Design

### Hypothesis

The hypothesis of this study is that there will be higher rates of adverse birth outcomes within imprisoned populations compared to a general population. That said, it is hypothesized that there are lower rates of adverse birth outcomes for imprisoned women compared to underserved populations due to guaranteed housing, consistent meals and guaranteed health checks, under the 8th amendment.

### Relationship Between Empirical Measure and Theoretical Construct of Interest

The differences between birth outcomes of incarcerated women and women in a general population will be used to quantify the impacts of imprisonment during pregnancy. The idea is that the population with the greater level of adverse birth outcomes is a less desirable condition for pregnancy. That said, it is notable that birth outcomes cannot be used to draw conclusions about womens’ personal experiences. For example, if there is a statistically significant difference between birth outcomes in an underserved population and birth outcomes in prison, that does not mean that at an individual level women have a better pregnancy experience.

### Data analysis and interpretation

The goal of this data analysis is to compare the outcomes within prisons and outside of prisons. In order to isolate the women in prison, the FIPS codes of prisons will be used to identify locations where children were born to incarcerated mothers. Further, payment by state will identify the desired population. In order to isolate the “underserved” population outside of prison, those whose primary payment mode is medicaid will be separated. Childbirths that do not fit into the incarcerated populations will fall into the “general” category. Once the three study populations are separated, they will be presented and compared. It will first be necessary to present the areas of interest in tables. For example, the average birth weights for each population will be presented. Next, it will be helpful to visually display differences using bar charts for each outcome. While the visualization of the bar charts are helpful, conclusions cannot be drawn from there. For that reason, T tests will then be run to establish if there is a significant difference. This process will be used for each type of birth outcome gathered. Further analyses will be run in order to present differences. This data analysis will lead to a discussion of the outcomes.

### Qualitative Addition

There may also be a qualitative component of this paper. Due to the deeply personal nature of this topic, it will be helpful to humanize the data using interviews from women who gave birth in prison. Many women who have endured this unique challenge are eager to share their stories on social media. To be consistent with the quantitative side of the study, there will be interviews conducted for women who have given birth in prison, women who have given birth in general and women who have given birth within an undesirable context. Standardized questions will be written for each interview, regarding the pregnancy experience discussing fears, relationship with health care professionals and more. The goal would not be to find a statistical difference, but rather to hear narratives from each experience: just because the birth outcomes may be quantitatively the same or different does not mean the experiences feel the same to the people living them.

## Limitations 

One issue with this data is that it is impossible to fully isolate incarceration as the reason for an effect. That is, while a statistical significance may speak for the difference between birth outcomes of incarcerated women and non incarcerated women, it is possible that there is a confounding factor which leads to this difference. Additionally, while the “disadvantaged” group encapsulates socioeconomic underserved populations, there are more adverse determinants of health that are not accounted for.

Furthermore, it is possible that the population outside of person may include recently released women; for this specific population, they would be considered non imprisoned, but would have experienced the effects of prenatal incarceration. It is also crucial to note that comparing specific birth outcomes cannot be used to draw conclusions about personal experiences. That is, the population with the fewest adverse birth outcomes cannot be said to be a “better” or “more desirable” pregnancy experience.
Finally, due to the need for clarification of payment by state prior to 2014, the data presented is not as recent as ideal. Unfortunately, there have not been major changes in the past 10 years for the given population, so the data up until 2014 may actually be representative of present day differences. That said, in future studies it would be helpful to use more updated data, if granted access directly to prison data.

## Contribution to Knowledge 

There is growing literature on the prevalence of childbirth in prison as well as descriptive studies explaining birth outcomes. That said, there are no recent studies that explore the difference in birth outcomes for imprisoned women to women in both a general population and an underserved population within the United States. Past studies have explored aspects of this paper, but none encapsulate all in one. For example, as discussed in the literature review, similar studies have been conducted in other countries. The outcomes of this study can then be compared to outcomes of similar studies done in other countries.

Ultimately, the outcomes will determine the given contributions. For example, if it is revealed that pregnancy in prison does lead to increased rates of adverse birth outcomes then this paper may be policy motivating. Further, this paper may be used to shine light on the conditions for whichever population has the least desirable birth outcomes. That is, if the group on medicaid has significantly worse outcomes than prisoners that may be telling of how damaging socioeconomic disadvantages can be in this country.

In conclusion, this study can be used to fill in gaps in a rarely studied population. Pregnant women in prison are an especially vulnerable population and deserve more attention. On top of exploring the data analysis in question, it is also important to share information on this group.
